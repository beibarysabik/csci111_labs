			<h2>Hello, World! I am Beibarys! I am from Taraz, Kazakhstan.</h2>
			<p><i>Today I will introduce you my hometown. Be ready!</i></p>
			<br>
			<p>First of all some nerdy information from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taraz">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
			<p><blockquote style="margin-right: 900px;"><i>Taraz (Kazakh: Тараз, تاراز, romanized: Taraz (listen); known to Europeans as Talas) is a city and the administrative center of Jambyl Region in Kazakhstan, located on the Talas (Taraz) River in the south of the country near the border with Kyrgyzstan. It had a population of 330,100 as of the 1999 census, up 9% from 1989, making it one of the fastest-growing cities in the country, after Nur-Sultan and Turkistan.</i></blockquote></p>
